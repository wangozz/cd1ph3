# Phase 3 Week 1 - Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions for the toy problems assigned in Phase 3, Week 1. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of programming in Python.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour Time to 24-hour Time

You are tasked with creating a function that converts a 12-hour time format to a 24-hour time format. The function takes an hour (1 to 12), a minute (0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm") as input and returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

### Challenge 2: Two Numbers are Positive

In this challenge, you will implement a function that takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments and determines if exactly two of them are positive numbers (greater than zero).

### Challenge 3: Consonant Value

For this challenge, your task is to write a function that calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. Consonants are defined as any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou", and their values are assigned according to their position in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, ..., z = 26).

## Usage

Each challenge is implemented as a separate Python function. To use them, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Python files corresponding to the challenges you want to explore.

3. You can run each function by calling it with the appropriate arguments.

## How to Submit

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Implement the solutions to the challenges.

3. Push your changes to your forked repository.

4. Submit the link to your forked repository for grading.
